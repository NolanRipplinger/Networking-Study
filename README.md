# Networking-Study
Preparation for an interview related to networking

Initially, I will be following this video (https://youtu.be/WDn-htpBlnU) to brush up on the creation
of a server and a client connection. From there, I will continue my research into sockets and networking
and also will hopefully have something cool to present for my interview!


Connect with PuTTY or another ssh client using

Host name: Name / ip of host,
Port: 1738, 
Connection type: Raw

Issues:
Server accepts end of line as second input.
